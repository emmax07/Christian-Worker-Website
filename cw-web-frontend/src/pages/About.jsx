          The church of Christ originally established on the day of Pentecost,
          A.D. 33 and the central guidance for churches of Christ is provided by
          the Lord from heaven. Local congregations are led by elders in
          accordance with the New Testament (Titus 1:5-9; 1 Timothy 3:1-15). The
          practices and teachings of each congregation are based solely on the
          Holy Scriptures which equip us fully for every good work (2 Timothy
          3:14-17). The directories are attempts by certain brethren and
          congregations to assist travelers and those searching for a
          congregation in their community. Various criteria have been used in
          compiling these lists, and no list can be complete or entirely
          reliable. The location of various congregation of the church of Christ
          in UK and Ireland can be found from this site. This is to make it as
          easy as possible to search for and find groups of Christians who are
          seeking to worship God in the way described in the Holy Bible. To
          search for any congregation click on the Church Directory or Church
          Search.

          In the salvation of man's soul there are 2 necessary parts: God's part
          and man's part. God's part is the big part, "For by grace you have
          been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift
          if God; not of works, that no man should glory" (Ephesians 2:8-9). The
          love which God felt for man led him to send Christ into the world to
          redeem man. The life and teaching of Jesus, the sacrifice on the
          cross, and the proclaiming of the gospel to men constitute God's part
          in salvation. Though God's part is the big part, man's part is also
          necessary if man is to reach heaven. Man must comply with the
          conditions of pardon which the Lord has announced. Man's part can
          clearly set forth in the following steps:
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Hear the Gospel:</b> "How shall they call on him whom they have not
          believed? And how shall they believe him whom they have not heard? And
          how shall they hear without a preacher?" (Romans 10:14). <br />
          <br />
          <b>Believe:</b> "And without faith it is impossible to be well
          pleasing unto him; for he that cometh to God must believe that he is,
          and that he is a rewarder of them that seek after him" (Hebrews 11:6).{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>Repent of past sins: </b>"The times of ignorance therefore God
          overlooked; but now he command men that they should all everywhere
          repent" (Acts 17:30). <br />
          <br />
          <b>Confess Jesus as Lord:</b>
          "Behold here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? And Philip
          said, if thou believeth with all thy heart thou mayest. And he
          answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God"
          (Acts 8:36-37).
          <br />
          <br />
          <b>
            Be baptized for the remission of sins: <br />
            <br />
          </b>{" "}
          "And Peter said unto them, Repent ye, and be baptized everyone of you
          in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins and ye
          shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:38). <br />
          <br />
          <b>Live a Christian life:</b> "Ye are an elect race, a royal
          priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's own possession, that ye
          may show forth the excellency of him who called you out of darkness
          into his marvelous light" (1 Peter 2:9).
